Yo! I’m Matt Nguyen. I’m a Software Engineer primarily focused on the following technologies:

* Ruby on Rails
* Elixir/Phoenix
* Ember JS
* Node.js
* iOS

This blog doesn’t have a real purpose except to record my ramblings about life, technology, and whatever else pops into my mind. It also serves as a life updater to everyone who’s interested in what I’m doing.
